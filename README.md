# CURD-API

This repo is an example for creating an API using Flask and Python. It can search the database on any type of segmentation of data. 
It includes a sample csv file consisting of 1000 lines of dummy data. Select the options that you want to include in the filter and add parameters for filtration of data.
For example, if you want to get data of male customers whose age is between 18 and 25, put a tick on the Age and the Gender checkboxes and add the required age group and gender specification.

## Usage
1. To install the required packages, run `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt` in Terminal while working in the CURD-API directory. 

2. Run: `python3 main.py`
  
If everything works successfully, the website will be available on the localhost server -> http://127.0.0.1:5000/
